# Making a Self Bow
_Tutored by Rich Frederiksen_

## Shaping outline
The bow stave is a quartered log. Put the bow into a workbench and use a draw knife to strip the bark from the back of the log. Once that's clean, stencil onto the wood the entire shap of the bow.

Taper just a bit, maybe 1/16" on a one-foot distance. But don't taper along most of the length of the limb. Use a micrometer to taper both sides evenly.

Use a band saw to cut the bow out more or less. Leave a wide margin. Grip the wood in a bow-making vise, and use a draw knife and/or power sander to approach the line you stencilled. Use a block sander to go halfway through the stencilled line.

## Handle
Keep at least this much material (see reference bow) in the handle.

## Back of the bow
Use a spoke shave, an edge of glass, or the draw knife (vertically) to shave down to an even layer across the back of the bow. You don't want to cut through a layer of wood on the back but rather have the entire back in a single layer. (Small knots may result in small breaks through a layer. That's okay.)

## String notches
1/2 inch from the tip, cut a forty five degree v-shaped notch using the 3/16" triangular file on the sides of the limbs (not faces). Make these grooves at least half the depth of the file

The string can be 2-4 inches shorter than the bow (notch to notch).

## Belly of the bow
Use the draw knife and belt sander to get down near to the draw weight you want. Press the bow against the ground on each side. Do limbs bend evenly?

If too heavy, scar the wood with rasp, just the depth of channel in rasp. Then use a sander until marks just disappear.

## Recurve
Put in recurve before tillering. Adding the recurve changes the tiller.

Heat the bow over stove, torch, etc until almost too hot to hold. Then clamp it against the form and leave it until it is cool.

## Tillering
Probably want about a 45 lb bow. We'll set it up in Rich's tillering jib. Tiller incrementally, first at 4", 8", etc, up to 28".

Don't hold bow at draw for long. That stress degrades the life of the bow.
