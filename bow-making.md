# Making a Self Bow
_Tutored by Rich Frederiksen_

1/2 inch from and forty five degree v notch using the 3/16" triangular file on the sides (not faces). Make grooves at least half the depth of the file

Shaping sides
Use power sander to reach line. Then use block sander to go halfway through line.

Shaping back
Use belt sander down til you get near the weight you want. Use micrometer to taper on both sides. Taper just a bit. Then for most of the length, don't taper. Maybe 1/16" on a one-foot distance.

Handle
Keep at least this much material (see reference bow) in the handle.

String can be 2-4 inches shorter than the bow (notch to notch).

Press against ground on each side. Do limbs bend evenly?

Shaping back
Pull bow. If too heavy:
Scar wood with rasp, just depth of channel in rasp. Then use sander until marks just disappear.

Put in recurve before tillering. Adding the recurve changes the tiller.

Recurve
Heat bow over stove, torch, etc until almost too hot to hold. Then

Probably want about a 45 lb bow. We'll set it up in Rich's tillering jib. Tiller incrementally, first at 4", 8", etc, up to 28".

Don't hold bow at draw for long. That stress degrades the life of the bow.
