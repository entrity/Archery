## 2022
7:45-8:45 was time designated for archers to pick up their score cards and maps.

Hazel and I left the house in Granite Bay at just after 6 am and arrived at about 8:30. There was a bit of line to get my score card. I had time at the practice range to figure out 3 string crawls but no more.

We had about 10 minutes to walk to our starting position. The horn blew at 9 to signal the start of shooting. We shot until 5 pm. It seemed to take a lot longer than day-1 of the comparable One Million BC shoot. We walked about five miles.

There were 42 targets.

There was also a fund raiser near one of the snack shacks: a very small balloon hung against a straw bale, supported on each side by a large nail. Hanging from the balloon was a 40 cm target with a cardboard backing. A pair of archers could address the challenge by having one shoot the balloon and the other shoot the paper target when it fell. The paper target must fall a short distance to stand between a pair of horizontal lines (about 40 cm apart) before being transfixed by an arrow for the challenge to be passed.
