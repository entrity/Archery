* 2021-09-04 ðŸ”‘ After anchor (i.e. for transfer-and-hold), _settle_ into alignment. That means that you shouldn't be pulling, your bow and bowstring will come toward each other slightly. _Then_ aim. _And then_ "aim and expand."
* 2021-09-06 After aim-and-expand, _pause_ and set your bow-hand grip. (It should really already be set, but think about the push and/or bow-drop. Ensure that the pressure of the bow lies against the heel of the bow hand, downward from the thumb.)
