# Ode to the Shot Cycle

_This was shared with myself and others by Dennis, the then-coach of the UC Berkeley archery team. I believe that he wrote it._

1. A proper stance is how it's begun
2. Nock the arrow in front of you
3. Set the hand at the proper degree
4. Set up some more to peek through the door
5. Draw and load, the back is alive
6. All is aligned when the anchor is fixed
7. Transfer and hold, the body's in heaven
8. Aim and expand to make it fly straight
9. Release with no mind, the arrow is fine
10. Follow through, then admire your ten
