# Making a bowstring

I've built a jig:

- (x2) square rod 6' x 1/2" x 1/2"
- (x2) threaded rod 1/4" x 12.5"
- (x4) threaded rod 1/4" x 2.5"
- (x8) 1/4" acorn nuts
- (x8) 1/4" flat washers
- (x8) 1/4" lock washers
- (x12) 1/4" nuts
- (x2) 4" x 1/2" brass tube (just big enough to be sleeve for the threaded rod; longer would be easier)
- (x4) 1" steel sleeve to cover the threaded rod.
- (x2) 1/4" x 3/4" bolts
- (x1) a free rod, at least 12.5" in length, small enough to pass through the loop of a bowstring

## The square rods: drilled holes
- From the south end, the vertical face is drilled with a 1/4" hole at intervals of 6" starting 1.5" from the south end, extending for most of the length of the rod.
- From the north end, the vertical face is drilled with a 1/4" hole at intervals of 1" starting 3" from the end, extending for 8 holes.
- From the north end, on the horizontal face, a hole is drilled 1" toward the center from the centremost of the 1"-spaced holes.
- From the north end, on the horizontal face, a hole is drilled 1" toward the end from the endmost of the 1"-spaced holes.
- From the south end, on the horizontal face, a hole is drilled halfway between the endmost vertical holes.

## Assembly
The long threaded rods pass through these horizontal holes to make an H-shape. (You have a choice of which horizontal holes to use at the north end.)

The brass tube should go on the threaded rod, between the square rods. This allows the string to pass down the centre of the assembly without cutting itself on the threaded rod.

On the threaded rod, outside of the brass tube but inside of the square rods, are a flat washer, a lock washer, and a nut on each side. On the outside of the suqare rods, an acorn nut covers the ends of the threaded rods. This system of washers and nuts allows the square rods to be pushed apart firmly when in use.

Four short, upright posts will do most of the holding of the string. These are built from the shorter threaded rods. Insert these rods into 4 of the vertical holes on the square rods, so that the four posts create a rectangle, whose perimeter is twice the length of the desired string.

At the bottom of the each post, screw an acorn nut. Above the square rod on each post, place a flat washer, lock washer, and nut, in the same way that this trio can be found on the horizontal threaded rods on the inside of the square rods. Above the nut, place the short, steel sleeve, then place another nut, to hold the sleeve in place and to create a barrier for the string. Now wrap some electrical tape about the nether half of the sleeve, wrapping repeatedly to create a thick, soft barrier to prevent the bowstring from slipping down onto the nut and washers below.

Place the 3/4" bolts facing downward into two vertical holes on the square rods. They don't need to be bolted into place. They are just there to hold the ends of the bowstring during the first part of stringmaking.

## Usage
Tighten the horizontal bolts to push the square rods firmly apart.

Tie the end of your string onto one of the vertical 3/4" bolts. Loop the string around your rectangle of short, upright posts until you have the number of threads you desire for your string. Cut the material and tie the bitter end off to the other 3/4" bolt.

Raise one end of the H (maybe prop it on your knees) so that your serving tool can be flipped over the string and pass beneath the assembly without hitting the ground.

Wrap your top-serving between one of the sets of posts. Free the ends of the string from your upright 3/4" bolts.

Free the top bolt from one of your vertical posts so that you can remove your string. Rearrange your string so that instead of going around all 4 posts, it proceeds from one post, then along the length of one square rod, then around another post, across the H, with the serving wrapped around a third post. With the serving looped, finish the winding to turn the serving into a loop.

Remove the string from the jig. Pass the newly created loop through a free rod and lay it horizontally so that it lies against the posts. Lay the free part of the string about the posts at the other and of the jig. Choose post positions and adjust nuts on the horizontal threaded rods so that the string is taught.

Wrap the serving for the other loop. Then as before, remove the string from the assembly and arrange it on three posts to finish serving the loop.

Put the string upon the bow and make the center serving there.
