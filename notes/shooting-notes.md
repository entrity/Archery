* 2021-08-27 :key: _NEVER_ let bowstring rest against side/chest. That indicates that the bow won't stay in position when you release.
* 2021-09-04 After anchor (i.e. for transfer-and-hold), _settle_ into alignment. That means that you shouldn't be pulling, your bow and bowstring will come toward each other slightly. _Then_ aim. _And then_ "aim and expand."
* 2021-09-06 After aim-and-expand, _pause_ and set your bow-hand grip. (It should really already be set, but think about the push and/or bow-drop. Ensure that the pressure of the bow lies against the heel of the bow hand, downward from the thumb.)
* 2021-09-07 Push+pull. Pause after aim-and-expand, ensure bow hand is pushing and holding aright.
* 2021-09-09 _Gentle_ push with bow hand. These are light limbs.
* 2021-09-09 Don't draw all the way to the chest before anchoring. Wasted effort.
* 2019-09-18 Don't drop bow. Soft release hand (check after release if not before+after)
* 2019-09-19 Not consistently keeping bow shoulder low. Suffering from stiff release.
* Tiller + brace height moved from (7 3/4", 9 1/4", 7, 1/2") (loud) to negative, letting out lower bolt (7 1/2", 9 1/4", 7 3/4") (quieter).
* 2019-09-21 If release is stiff, is expansion really in back or just arm? Use new draw (not into chest), but forget the other stuff (setting up far downward and to the left). Bow hand: heel contact. Low bow shoulder. Don't drop bow arm.
* 2019-09-28 Bring both shoulder blades together (not so much pushing my bow arm outward or letting it get crushed inward, leading to high bow shoulder). Bring right elbow around back.
* 2019-09-29 :key: Instead of pulling bow shoulder to the right to expand, focus on circling the elbow backward (toward your rear). Then the arrow will cease wobbling. For the 2nd scoring round, I had to crawl less by almost an entire large mark. After a bad shot (or two or three), slow down the shot process. Aim with the arrow point instead of the line between the arrow and the plunger. Pause at aim to see whether arrow wobbles.
