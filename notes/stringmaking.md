# Stringmaking

My most consistent failing has been using too little serving material.

I make a 16-strand 67" string,

## Top loop
Rotate posts. Serve about 4 1/3".

The loop should be 2" (very precise) when done, so stop wrapping short of that so that you can wrap a final 10 winds around the end of the string.

When you finish serving this, rotate the posts so that the serving is centered on the post with equal lengths on each side. Then unwind some serving from the winder to a distance of about 6" from the post and start winding backward toward the serving you just wrapped.

After you serve far enough to meet the previous serving and wrap 3 times around it, pull an additional 8-10" of material off of the winder and cut the thread. Then do that neat technique to kill the thread with about 10 more wraps.

## Bottom loop
Serve 3".

The loop should be between 1" and 1 1/2".

Same technique as the top loop.

## Center serving
Take string off the jig and put it on the bow. Serve from an inch above the arrow rest to about the bottom of the grip.

Wrap in the direction that will tighten the serving when your string hand pulls the string.
