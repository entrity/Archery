# Compound Equipment

## Unlimited vs Bowhunter
### Compound Unlimited
40"-48" axel to axel

Tend to have a window (not just cutaway). Window provides support on both sides of the arrow, valuable because without the support the riser actually bends when you draw. (You correct for this bend with your sight and so don't notice it in bows without the window.)

### Bowhunter
30" axel to axel
typically $12$" stab in front, $7 \pm 1$" stab in back
no electronics, no adjusting the sight (during the round), no lense
draw 50 lbs, let-off to 20 lbs

Teresa has 80% letoff. *PSE Phenom SD* - like a hybrid between bowhunter and compound unlimited

## Parts & Accessories
### Sights
2 types: (1) multipin and (2) single pin
multipin is more confusing for beginners
### Rests
2 types of rest: (1) static and (2) dropaway
dropaway has a cable attached to the string: the blade of the rest goes up and down quickly and automatically

whisker biscuit: safer for beginner (than lizard tongue) because it allows the archer to cant the bow without dropping the arrow from the arrow rest
### Cable guard
Cable guard maintains tension of cables during draw
### Releases
3 main types:
1. finger trigger - goes around wrist - more common in hunting so that the release is always close at hand.
2. thumb trigger - like the club ones
3. back tension - rotate fingers or relax index finger and let release tilt forward
	- easy to misfire and not allowed in the club
	- allows you to concentrate on arm, not worry about follow through 

## Adjustments
Add or subtract twists on cables or string to change the **draw weight**

Change **draw length** by changing "models" (holes on cams). For higher-end bows, this is not an option (for the sake of consistency). You can add a draw stop on some bows to compensate for the sponginess of the draw length.

Lower-end bows are designed to be adjustable and grow with you.

## Beginners
Simon recommends entry-level bow, e.g. Hoyt Ignite or Bear Cruzer
