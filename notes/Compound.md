*Notes from Simon's Compound Equipment Meeting held 2018-12-02.*
# Compound Equipment

## Unlimited vs Bowhunter
### Compound Unlimited
40"-48" axel to axel

Tend to have a window (not just cutaway). Window provides support on both sides of the arrow, valuable because without the support the riser actually bends when you draw. (You correct for this bend with your sight and so don't notice it in bows without the window.)

### Bowhunter
30" axel to axel
typically $12$" stab in front, $7 \pm 1$" stab in back
no electronics, no adjusting the sight (during the round), no lense
draw 50 lbs, let-off to 20 lbs

Teresa has 80% letoff. *PSE Phenom SD* - like a hybrid between bowhunter and compound unlimited

## Accessories
### Sights
2 types: (1) multipin and (2) single pin
multipin is more confusing for beginners
### Rests
2 types of rest: (1) static and (2) dropaway
dropaway has a cable attached to the string: the blade of the rest goes up and down quickly and automatically

whisker biscuit: safer for beginner (than lizard tongue) because it allows the archer to cant the bow without dropping the arrow from the arrow rest
