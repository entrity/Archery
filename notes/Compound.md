*Notes from Simon's Compound Equipment Meeting held 2018-12-02.*
# Compound Equipment

## Unlimited vs Bowhunter
### Compound Unlimited
40"-48" axel to axel

### Bowhunter
30" axel to axel
typically $12$" stab in front, $7 \pm 1$" stab in back
no electronics, no adjusting the sight (during the round), no lense
draw 50 lbs, let-off to 20 lbs

Teresa has 80% letoff. *PSE Phenom SD* - like a hybrid between bowhunter and compound unlimited

## Accessories
### Sights
2 types: (1) multipin and (2) single pin
multipin is more confusing for beginners
### Rests
2 types of rest: (1) static and (2) dropaway
dropaway has a cable attached to the string: the blade of the rest goes up and down quickly and automatically

whisker biscuit: safer for beginner (than lizard tongue) because it allows the archer to cant the bow without dropping the arrow from the arrow rest
