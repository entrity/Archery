Victor had me shoot his uukha limbs. Wow. 27" riser, x-long limbs. Felt so smooth. Abbey pointed out that I was dropping my bow arm when shooting his bow, which was much heavier than mine.

Victor put the uukhas on my 25" riser and added another 8oz weight. Too heavy. The limbs didn't feel as smooth. He pointed out the brace height was crazy big, and a longer string was needed.

Victor suggested that my jager CMS grip was high (meaning that the heel of my hand was high, i.e. my hand wasn't gripping a pole-like object. He suggested I need to cut mine down to about halfway through the rubber palm pad using a file. He suggested that would help me prevent my bow shoulder rising up, which he said didn't happen when I shot his bow. (After about an hour with a file, I made neglible progress into the grip.)

Bill pointed out that my release had was stiff (noticeable after release), needs to be relaxed.
