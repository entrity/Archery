# Shot process

1. Straight stance.
1. Nock
1. Crawl
	- Ordinary hook, not a slant as I used at school.
	- Most of my weight is held on middle finger, then index, then ring finger.
1. Tighten core (bring bottom of hip forward, buttocks tighten)
1. Set grip on bow and pre-draw
	- Put the pressure against the bow on the meat of the hand on the thumb side, at the bottom of the palm.
	- The hand should not wrap around the bow. The hand should be open but the fingers relaxed.
	- The knuckles of the hand should form approximately a 45-degree line.
	- Tighten the bow string just enough that the arrow moves back a bit.
1. Set up and pre-aim
	- Height is important. Bring the plunger up to just beneath the gold.
1. Draw
	- Slow draw with strong bow arm pushing gently forward. Feel the line running down the bow-side of the torso tighten.
  - Draw with weight more on middle finger than index finger.
  - I have been drawing at a bit of an angle (not straight out, not down-up, about 45 degrees).
1. Anchor
	- Come to anchor: point of index finger above the lip, feeling for the space between canine and front teeth in upper jaw
	- Weight should be transfered to skeleton, held by the back.
1. Aim
	- Put the point of the arrow on gold.
	- Bring the string blur behind the arrow (making it hard to look down the arrow).
	- Correct any severe cant.
	- Ensure you can look down the arrow and see a straight line; don't let the arrow be pointing in from the side of your face; it should be in front of your aiming eye.
1. Expand
	- While aiming, pull your shoulder blade (at least the draw-shoulder blade) inward toward the spine and downward.
1. Release and follow through
	- Relax the string fingers.
	- String hand should automatically move backward or fall dead but not move outward, away from face.
	- Bow hand should automatically move forward
	- Bow should scarcely move left/right/down (but might move up, depending on crawl and tiller).

Feels like old times.

**Troubleshooting**
If arrows go down:
	draw shoulder not locked down (maybe locked up)
If arrows go right (collapse): probably leaning backward (sending hips forward but not torso).
	shift weight onto leading foot during anchoring
	"shoulders back" on draw side
If arrows go left:
	Fix cant and maybe string blur?

**Troubleshooting**
- If arrows go _left_: make sure that the draw step is correct: slow draw pushing bow arm forward and keeping plunger in near constant position. Bow arm should stay engaged. If all else fails, check for a cant.
- If arrows go quite _low_: make sure that your draw shoulder blade is not getting locked in an upward position. Make sure your draw is strong. Feel the draw shoulder blade engage.

## Notes
- Bow arm should stay engaged during draw and aim.
- At aim, arrow should not wobble.
- At aim, I should be aligned, and there shouldn't be excessive stress on arms or shoulders, though both sides should be engaged.

**Maybes**
- Draw toward chin, not toward body. this helps prevent loss of bow arm engagement
- pre-aim on gold
- bring in string blur
