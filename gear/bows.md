# Bows

## 2023 Self bow
Osage Orange 70 5/8"
String 66" twisted

Fashioned only with hand tools (draw-knife, chisel, sandpaper) except for a band saw to rough out the shape toward the beginning after de-barking the quartered log.

To shoot, put the pressure against the hand high in the hand but below the thumb-finger notch; this is different to when I shoot a modern barebow and put my pressure at the heel of the hand. Apply gentle pressure with the fingertips of the top three fingers against the back of the bow; gentle pressure should prevent the bow twisting upon release.
