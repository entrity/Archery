# Troubleshooting trouble shooting

**Is the arrow wobbling while aiming?**\
You're not in alignment.
* During expansion, instead of pulling the bow arm/shoulder rightward, focus on circling the elbow back around toward the behind.
* If your bow arm is collapsing, focus on rotating your body away from the bow during setup and draw.

**Is release stiff?**\
Check whether expansion is really in the back or just in the arm. (See note about circling the elbow backward.)

**Are arrows inconsistently going low (or going to inconsistently low fieldage)?**\
If expansion is not the culprit (see note about circling the elbow), check whether you're dropping your bow arm on release.

**Are arrows going to the right?**\
You may be collapsing. Bring your shoulder blades together during aim+expand. If necessary, rotate your body away from the bow during setup+draw. If necessary, invert your stance so that your string foot is farther to the rear than your bow foot.
