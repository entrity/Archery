# Troubleshooting trouble shooting

**Is the arrow wobbling while aiming?**\
You're not in alignment.
* During expansion, instead of pulling the bow arm/shoulder rightward, focus on circling the elbow back around toward the behind.
* If your bow arm is collapsing, focus on rotating your body away from the bow during setup and draw.

**Is release stiff?**
Check whether expansion is really in the back or just in the arm. (See note about circling the elbow backward.)
