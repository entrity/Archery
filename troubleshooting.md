# Troubleshooting trouble shooting

## Checklist

- Are you drawing slowly with middle finger?
- Are you leaning backward at all?
- Is bow arm engaged throughout expansion?
- Is bow arm pushing forward during slow draw?
- Is index finger relaxed when it's time to loose?
- Is bow canting?
- Is string blur in place?
- Is arrow steady upon expansion?

## Signs (good & bad)

- Is bow arm moving to either side upon release?
- Is string hand moving away from face upon release?
- Is bow hand following through upon release?

**Arrows at 12 o'clock** might indicate a bounce upward at release.

**Arrows to the RIGHT or HIGH-RIGHT** indicate collapse. See "Collapse" below.

**Is the arrow wobbling while aiming?**\
You're not in alignment.
* During expansion, instead of pulling the bow arm/shoulder rightward, focus on circling the elbow back around toward the behind.
* If your bow arm is collapsing, focus on rotating your body away from the bow during setup and draw.

**Is release stiff?**\
Check whether expansion is really in the back or just in the arm. (See note about circling the elbow backward.)

**Are arrows inconsistently going low (or going to inconsistently low fieldage)?**\
If expansion is not the culprit (see note about circling the elbow), check whether you're dropping your bow arm on release.

**Are arrows going to the right?**
See "Collapse" below.

**Are arrows going to the left?**
You might be canting. Stop and check the cant. Maybe bring in the string blur.
You might be over-expanding. Take it easy. Maybe adjust stance (more or less inverted) so that you can hold the bow steady and have the arrows land on target.

**Are arrows going high?** You might have index finger tight on the string. I want middle finger to carry most of the tension. It makes for a smoother release and a safer hook.

**Are arrows going low?** You might be leaning away from target, causing your bow shoulder to rise.
- Don't drop bow arm.
- Don't suddenly push bow upon release.

**If you need to pull the bow leftward at release**, that's a problem. See "Collapse" below.

**If you are hitting your arm**, you might be overdrawing.

## Collapse
Watch for signs of collapse:
- bow moves left or right after release.
- arrows land RIGHT or HIGH-RIGHT.
Combat collapse with:
- strong draw; constant forward push
- rotating torso away so that shoulders line up perpendicular to target
- slight inversion of stance
- expansion doesn't pull draw shoulder to away from the target but instead toward your rear
