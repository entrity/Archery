# Shot process

**transfer, steady, open, pause**

- deeper hook
- slighter expansion
- longer pause

1. straight stance
2. nock
3. crawl 7 1/4 marks
4. slant hook
5. set up on gold
6. straight draw
7. anchor (pre-aim on gold)
8. transfer. bring string blur onto outside of arrow rest (right of riser)
9. correct any cant and ensure index finger is loose (compared with middle finger)
10. expand: open on bow side (not downward, not upward) but don't go overboard, slightly engage bow arm
11. pause (ensure arrow is not wobbling)
12. upon release, the bow should scarcely move (on either axis)

- If arrows are going **high-right**, you have collapsed. Be sure to expand on _both_ sides; open up, don't just lower draw shoulder.
- If arrows are going **high**:
	- You might be lowering the draw shoulder pronouncedly. As part of expansion, you should open up and slightly tuck down the draw shoulder blade.
	- You might have index finger tight on the string. I want middle finger to carry most of the tension. It makes for a smoother release and a safer hook.
- If arrows are going **low**, you might not be expanding. Or you might not be engaging your bow arm enough. Or you might be pulling backward (away from target) instead of rearward (toward your rear)
- Don't drop bow arm.
- Don't suddenly push bow upon release.
- If you find you need to pull the bow leftward at release, that's a problem. Ensure your expansion is opening, not just lowering (and not raising).
