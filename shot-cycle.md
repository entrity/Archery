# Shot process

**strong draw; shift forward**

1. straight stance
    - inverted stance is also okay
2. nock
3. crawl a bold 8 marks
4. slant hook
5. set up
    - (+) put point of arrow up on gold. height is important
    - (+) rotate torso away so that it is parallel to the shot
    - set bow hand against bow (not gripping)
6. draw
    - (+) strong draw. keep bow arm engaged
    - (+) straight draw, not USAA b/c curve draw is inhibited by torso rotation
    - (+) draw toward chin, not toward body. this helps prevent loss of bow arm engagement
    - (+) draw with weight on middle finger, not index
7. anchor
    - pre-aim on gold
    - bring in string blur
8. pause
    - correct any bow cant
    - arrow should not wobble or circle
    - keep bow arm engaged all the way down. don't let the bow shoulder come in
9. upon release, the bow should scarcely move (on either axis)
