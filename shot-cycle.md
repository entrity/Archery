# Shot process

1. Straight stance. A little off, either inverted or open, is fine.
2. Nock
3. Crawl
	- Maybe a slant hook. Maybe it doesn't matter.
	- Most of the weight is held on middle finger, then index, then ring finger.
4. Tighten core (bring bottom of hip forward)
5. Set up
	- Height is important.
	- Arrow goes left of gold (above paper in my experiments with uncut arrows).
	- Plunger goes beneath target, centered on gold.
	- Set bow hand against bow (not gripping), with pressure primarily on the meaty part of the thumb side of the heal.
6. Draw
	- Slow draw with strong bow arm pushing gently forward.
  - Draw with weight more on middle finger than index finger.
  - I prefer a straight draw (bow dips down then up, rather than out to the side).
7. Anchor
	- Come to anchor: point of index finger above the lip, feeling for the space between canine and front teeth in upper jaw
	- String blur should be behind riser, in front of face.
8. Expand & aim
	- Move right through anchor without stopping and bring draw shoulder into expansion (locking neither upward nor downward). The draw shoulder blade should be pulled in toward the spine, but once in position, there should be no strain in pulling it inward. Strain will make the shot unsteady.
	- Then shift focus to the bow arm, which must push gently forward toward the target. Again, no strain. Focus on push and aim. Watch for steadiness. After the first round, put more focus into the push than you naturally tend to do.
	- Maybe check for cant (anticlockwise) and correct it, even overcorrecting if necessary, though this tends to bring the string blur rightward away from the bow. Overcorrecting does also tend to make the draw shoulder easier to hold in place without locking the string hook, making for an easy release, but you really shouldn't need this sort of compensation; you should be able to get a good release without it.
9. Release & follow through
	- String hand should automatically move backward
	- Bow hand should automatically move forward
	- Bow should scarcely move left/right/down (but might move up, depending on crawl and tiller).

Feels like old times.

**Troubleshooting**
If arrows go down:
	draw shoulder not locked down (maybe locked up)
If arrows go right (collapse): probably leaning backward (sending hips forward but not torso).
	shift weight onto leading foot during anchoring
	"shoulders back" on draw side
If arrows go left:
	Fix cant and maybe string blur?

**Troubleshooting**
- If arrows go _left_: make sure that the draw step is correct: slow draw pushing bow arm forward and keeping plunger in near constant position. Bow arm should stay engaged. If all else fails, check for a cant.
- If arrows go quite _low_: make sure that your draw shoulder blade is not getting locked in an upward position. Make sure your draw is strong. Feel the draw shoulder blade engage.

## Notes
- Bow arm should stay engaged during draw and aim.
- At aim, arrow should not wobble.
- At aim, I should be aligned, and there shouldn't be excessive stress on arms or shoulders, though both sides should be engaged.

**Maybes**
- Draw toward chin, not toward body. this helps prevent loss of bow arm engagement
- pre-aim on gold
- bring in string blur
