# Shot process

## Shooting high (maybe higher than top target at indoor events)
1. Straight stance
2. Nock
3. Crawl 8 marks
	- Slant hook
	- Most of the weight is held on middle finger (not index)
4. Tighten core (bring bottom of hip forward)
5. Set up
	- Height is important.
	- Arrow goes left of gold; plunger goes beneath target, centered on gold.
	- Set bow hand against bow (not gripping)
6. Draw
	- Slow draw
	- Strong draw
  - Straight draw, not USAA b/c curve draw is inhibited by torso rotation
  - Draw with weight on middle finger, not index finger.
	- Hips should rotate so that torso moves to 90 degrees from target face
7. Anchor
	- Arrow should go up, above gold, and come down a bit but stay high.
	- I lock draw shoulder (blade) down.
	- Weight should shift forward slightly onto leading foot.
8. Aim
	- String blur should already be in (in line w/ riser) and straight (no cant).
	- Move bow arm downward while keeping draw shoulder locked in place.
	- Pause when at aim.
9. Release & follow through
	- String hand should automatically move backward
	- Bow should automatically move forward
	- Bow should scarcely move left/right/up/down

**Troubleshooting**
If arrows go down:
	draw shoulder not locked down (maybe locked up)
If arrows go right (collapse): probably leaning backward (sending hips forward but not torso).
	shift weight onto leading foot during anchoring
	"shoulders back" on draw side
If arrows go left:
	Fix cant and maybe string blur?

## Shooting _not_ high
1. Straight stance
2. Nock
3. Crawl 8 1/2 marks
	- Slant hook
	- Most of the weight is held on middle finger (not index)
4. Tighten core (bring bottom of hip forward)
5. Set up
	- Height is important.
	- Arrow goes left of gold (above paper in my experiments with uncut arrows).
	- Plunger goes beneath target, centered on gold.
	- Set bow hand against bow (not gripping)
6. Draw
	- Make the bow arm strong _before_ draw begins. After the draw has started would be too late.
	- During slow draw, push bow arm forward.
  - Draw with weight on middle finger, not index finger.
7. Anchor
	- _Don't_ try to lock draw shoulder blade down.
	- _Definitely don't_ lock draw shoulder blade upward.
	- Come to anchor.
	- String blur should be behind riser or arrow, in front of face.
8. Expand & aim
	- Push bow arm forward and tighten draw shoulder blade toward spine. Draw shoulder should tighten more than move. Tighten just enough for arrow to become steady. Don't go nuts. Bow arm should not pull rearward or sink into torso, just push forward.
	- Check for cant.
9. Release & follow through
	- String hand should automatically move backward
	- Bow should automatically move forward
	- Bow should scarcely move left/right/up/down

**Troubleshooting**
- If arrows go _left_: make sure that the draw step is correct: slow draw pushing bow arm forward and keeping plunger in near constant position. Bow arm should stay engaged. If all else fails, check for a cant.
- If arrows go quite _low_: make sure that your draw shoulder blade is not getting locked in an upward position. Make sure your draw is strong. Feel the draw shoulder blade engage.

## Notes
- Bow arm should stay engaged during draw and aim.
- At aim, arrow should not wobble.
- At aim, I should be aligned, and there shouldn't be excessive stress on arms or shoulders, though both sides should be engaged.

**Maybes**
- Draw toward chin, not toward body. this helps prevent loss of bow arm engagement
- pre-aim on gold
- bring in string blur
