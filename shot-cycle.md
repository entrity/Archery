# Shot process

**transfer, correct, open, pause**

1. straight stance
2. nock
3. crawl 7 1/4 marks
4. slant hook
5. set up on gold
6. straight draw
7. anchor (pre-aim on gold)
8. transfer
9. correct any cant and ensure index finger is loose (compared with middle finger)
10. open (downward, but not just downward; expand both sides; subtly lower right shoulder blade; string might touch nose)
11. pause to ensure arrow is not wobbling
12. upon release, the bow should scarcely move (on either axis)

- If arrows are going **high-right**, you have collapsed. Be sure to expand on _both_ sides; open up, don't just lower draw shoulder.
- If arrows are going **high**:
	- You might be lowering the draw shoulder pronouncedly. As part of expansion, you should open up and slightly tuck down the draw shoulder blade.
	- You might have index finger tight on the string. I want middle finger to carry most of the tension. It makes for a smoother release and a safer hook.
- If arrows are going **low**, you might not be expanding.
- Don't drop bow arm.
- Don't suddenly push bow upon release.
- If you find you need to pull the bow leftward at release, that's a problem. Ensure your expansion is opening, not just lowering (and not raising).
